        <p>Stress is a common feeling we get when we feel under pressure, overwhelmed or unable to cope. 
           Small amounts of stress can be good for us and motivate us to achieve goals like taking an exam or giving a speech. 
           But too much of it, especially when it feels out of control, can negatively impact our mood, physical and mental well-being and relationships.

        <p>There are various different things in life that can cause stress. Some of the main sources of stress include money, work,       
           relationships, parenting, and day-to-day troubles.
           Stress can trigger the body's response to a perceived threat or danger, known as the fight-or-flight response.During this reaction, 
           certain hormones like adrenaline and cortisol are released. This speeds the heart rate, slows digestion, 
           shunts blood flow to major muscle groups, and changes various other autonomic nervous functions, 
           giving the body a burst of energy and strength which enables us to physically fight or run away when faced with danger, 
           the fight-or-flight response is now activated in situations where neither response is appropriateâ€”like in traffic or during a stressful day at work.
           When the perceived threat is gone, systems are designed to return to normal function via the relaxation response.But in cases of chronic stress, 
           the relaxation trigger doesn't happen often enough, and being in a near-constant state of fight or flight can harm to the body.
           Stress can also lead to some unhealthy habits that have a negative impact on your health. For example, 
           many people manage stress by eating too much or by smoking. These unhealthy habits damage the body and create bigger problems in the long-term</p>

        <p>Although meditation might seem unnecessary for those who have never done it before. 
           Meditation can help relax you, calm you down and help you decompress and center back into yourself. 
           You can follow along with breathing exercises or audio to help you. While you can meditate for lengthy periods, 
           even dedicating five minutes every day to your practice can yield so many relaxing benefits.</p>
